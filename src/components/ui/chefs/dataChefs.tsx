    text: "Growing up in Ninohe, a city in northern Japan famed for its spring water, sake and rice, and raised by parents who ran a boutique hotel, Miho Sato spent her formative years surrounded by an abundance of local produce, developing an early awareness of its origins and seasonality. ‘I wouldn’t say that growing up there influenced my relationship with food, but it influenced my relationship with ingredients and nature,’ she nods. Early memories of family dinners include okonomiyaki, a comforting savoury pancake (Miho uses her mother’s recipe for it in her current menu), but while cooking was at the core of much of her childhood, when it came time to move into the world of work Miho was instead drawn to the precision and accuracy of medicine and, in particular, orthodontics. ‘I have so much admiration for the medical industry. The treatment doctors give can be lifesaving, and maybe training as an orthodontist was as close as I could get to really helping people,’ she smiles. ‘I had a very simple childhood; I grew up in a small town surrounded by amazing seasonal ingredients at our fingertips, so it's no surprise that I became a chef, but I don’t think I knew that was my calling early on. While the likeness between dentistry and sushi might not be immediately obvious, over time Miho began to see more similarities between the two (both are arts which require ‘acute attention to detail’, she says) and eventually decided to make the leap. ‘I fell in love with how each nigiri takes on a different personality,’ she says, ‘as it’s created with different ingredients and techniques that all command respect in different ways.’ Training to be a sushi chef in Japan is, of course, no easy task, and in 1997 Miho became one of just a few women to graduate with a Japan National Professional Cooking Sushi Certificate. It came after a decade of intense training, covering everything from deft, delicate knife skills to a mastery of both sushi rice and fish preparation. Soon after, she was chosen for a sushi chef role at JFC Daitokai restaurant in Germany’s Cologne, a teppanyaki restaurant which brought her to Europe and put her in front of customers for the first time. It was an influential time in her life, and one which taught her a lesson she still holds dear today – train hard, learn always. ‘I was very scared at the beginning but I knew I had to master this fear,’ she smiles. ‘I remember one of my first services; I was the teppanyaki chef for a group including the President of Kikkoman, a very, very big Japanese company which also owned Daitokai JFC. I was so nervous but he said my behaviour was ‘professional’ – which is a big compliment in Japanese culture. Four years later, at the end of 2001, Miho made the move to London to join the (now-closed) teppanyaki spot Matsuri, quickly settling into life in the capital. ‘I have always loved walking – in so many Japanese cities people will walk around simply for pleasure,’ she smiles. ‘Chelsea and Covent Garden are such good areas for walking around and finding food to take and enjoy along the way in the fresh air. That’s what made me feel like London could be my new home.’ Stints at Sushi Hana and Oblix at the Shard followed, where Miho worked her way from chef de partie to head chef in just four years. There, she worked alongside Fabian Beaufour, who she counts among the most influential mentors of her career. ‘I was impressed by all the French, European and American dishes he created when Oblix opened,’ she says. ‘I have always respected his professionalism very much – that was my first experience of working with a French chef.’ A spell at Mayfair private members’ club Annabel’s was next, introducing Miho to an at-any-cost approach where exceptionally high-quality and rare ingredients were weaved into classic Japanese cooking.",

    text: "With a father who was a fruit and vegetable merchant and a brother working as a chef, Marcus Wareing, who was raised in the north west of England, has always been surrounded by food in one way or another. Given his status as one of the most high-profile successful chefs working in Britain today, it seems somewhat surprising that he was initially more interested in following in his father’s footsteps than those of his brother. However, seeing no future in the family business, his father encouraged Marcus to pursue a different career and his brother suggested he undertake a catering course at Southport College. From being – by his own admission – a 'mediocre school student', Marcus suddenly found himself top of his class, catching the eye of more than one of his tutors as being a naturally gifted chef. After shining in a local catering competition, it wasn’t long before an ambitious young Marcus was recommended for a position at the Savoy, working in a kitchen with over 100 other chefs. After leaving the Savoy he worked at the prestigious Roux establishment Le Gavroche before moving on to work at some of the finest restaurants around the world including The Point in New York, The Grand in Amsterdam, Guy Savoy in Paris and Aubergine, Gordon Ramsay’s first restaurant. At the latter, Marcus took on a position as sous chef, an experience that would redefine his approach to hard work. Marcus’ precision and dedicated work ethic paid off and the chef achieved Michelin stars during his time at both L’Oranger and the Savoy Grill. In 1999 Marcus became chef patron of the much lauded Pétrus, the restaurant attached to the opulent Berkeley Hotel, earning two Michelin stars during his nine-year tenure. Deciding to forge his own path Marcus took over the lease of Pétrus in 2008. Rebranded as simply Marcus in 2014, the restaurant underwent extensive refurbishment to reflect the chef’s desire to shake up the notoriously formal fine dining scene. His vision was a flexible, relaxed restaurant that would still serve up cuisine of the highest quality and serve the needs of whoever sat down to eat. It was a formula that proved successful and the restaurant has retained its place in the Michelin Guide ever since.",

    text: "Cynthia Shanmugalingam’s first memories of Sri Lanka are from a family holiday when she was just three. It wasn’t her first visit – her parents had been taking her since she was a baby – but it was, for obvious reasons, the first that stuck. During their holiday, the family travelled across the island, an opportunity they didn't realise would, after the outbreak of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 1983, become impossible until the millennium had passed. ‘I can still remember it,’ Cynthia says. ‘We ate red beans, which I hadn’t seen before, and lots of fresh fish. My friends in England were going to Disney, which I thought sounded magical and was really jealous of, but we had this cultural immersion in a world that my parents knew really well, but had left behind.That’s not to say that, back at home in Coventry, the cultural education stopped. Far from it – brought up in a Sri Lankan Tamil family, Cynthia was raised on authentic island cooking. ‘As a culture we have an obsessive relationship with food,’ she laughs. ‘My mum, and for a few years my grandmother when she lived with us, cooked Sri Lankan food for us every day. My dad, as well, would dice tinned sardines with turmeric, black pepper, green chilli and lime and we would have that on toast. My mum would make chicken curry, one of her homeliest things, while my grandmother would make pongal rice, a comforting coconut rice, which was sometimes savoury and sometimes sweet.’ Despite its centrality in her life, food wasn’t in Cynthia’s career plans; instead, she graduated from Cambridge with a degree in economics and for a while worked at the Treasury, motivated, she says, by a desire to understand how the world works. A turning point came while she was working at a social enterprise in Bethnal Green. As she rose through the ranks, she found herself managing complex projects, on conference calls to people all over the world and, ultimately, stressed and frustrated. Though she was overseeing important work, it wasn’t hers. ‘I was sure I wanted to run my own thing,’ she nods. It was a friend who lived across the road from a food business incubator in the US, called La Cocina, that planted the seed for what came next. At the time, social media was beginning to play a bigger role in marketing, crowdfunding was taking off and the economics of starting a business were changing. ‘I knew it might be fun to help people start restaurants, although I had zero understanding of how to do that,’ she laughs.",

    text: "The sharing of food is at the heart of many cultures, not least in West Africa, where meals unite not just families, but entire communities. ‘African culture is based on food and the hospitality aspect of it – if you have friends or family coming around, the first thing you do is offer them something to eat,’ chef Ayo Adeyemi smiles. ‘It’s not even an offer, really – it’s more a case of ‘you must eat’. You can’t go into the household without eating. I always loved food growing up and I was always curious watching my mum cook. Ayo was born in Scotland, but raised in Poole by Nigerian parents, and he grew up on the likes of steamed black-eyed bean cake moin moin, akara (a fried version), egusi stew and jollof rice. But with West African culture scant in Dorset, his family made monthly trips to London to refill the pantry, introducing a young Ayo to the styles of different Nigerian communities. ‘We only had a few family friends who were of African heritage nearby,’ Ayo says, ‘so whenever there’d be gatherings of the families, that was definitely when my mum would cook a larger spread of dishes. My mum’s jollof was renowned as being the best jollof out of all the families, and seeing the way she would prepare and cook everything was just amazing. She was an inspiration to me. By the time he was sixteen, Ayo was already set on becoming a chef and enrolled at University College of Birmingham to study culinary arts. His mind might have been made up, but it wasn’t an easy decision – having been keen for him to head into a more academic pursuit, his family took a bit more convincing. But Ayo’s resolve didn’t waver. ‘What opened my eyes at that age was seeing the likes of Gordon Ramsay cooking Michelin-level food, such a refined food style, modern British but with French influence,’ he says. ‘To do it in a wonderful restaurant environment and get three Michelin stars and then open multiple restaurants – I always had that vision of doing something like that with West African cuisine and taking it around the world. Through his studies he travelled, getting real-world experience in kitchens across America in particular. ‘I just wanted to travel and see the world and felt that you could really travel through food,’ he nods. ‘I felt that was really important, that it was a really good way to understand so many different cultures and different styles of food.’ After graduating, he returned to the US, joining the Michelin-starred Campton Place in San Francisco under head chef Srijith Gopinathan, who melded Indian and western flavours and first crystallised Ayo’s vision of doing the same. ‘He was the first real mentor for me,’ he says. ‘I was there as a chef de partie and I learned so much. The style of what he was doing was French fused with Indian, using Indian spices and flavours and American produce. That’s exactly what planted a seed for me. That’s what set me off on my journey.",
